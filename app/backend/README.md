1. **Server Configuration**: Files to configure and start the backend server, such as `server.js` or `app.py`.
2. **Routes**: Definitions for API endpoints.
3. **Controllers**: Logic to handle requests and responses.
4. **Models**: Definitions for data structures and database schemas.
5. **Services**: Business logic and interactions with external services or databases.
6. **Middleware**: Functions to process requests before they reach the final route handler.
